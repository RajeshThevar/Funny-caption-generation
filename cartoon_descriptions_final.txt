510 that camping the canyons of wall street groupon may have been bad idea

510 stargazing is more challenging during the day
510 and so decided couldnt just watch the world pass me by needed to be part of it
510 stanley our local grammar enthusiast is at it again folks this week he asked people if they knew whether or not he was laying or lying on the sidewalk
510 in spite of no longer being able to afford them dave decides he cannot do without his weekly deep tissue massages
510 save our soles
510 all this development is new since was kid
510 my autopiloted car is stuck in traffic
510 flat stanley here tripping the blight fantastic
510 only in new york would anyone think this funny
510 in my life theres no difference between going to the office or staying home
510 wish everyone would just stop walking all over me
510 how do you like it when we occupy your street
510 step on crack break your fathers back
510 its true if youre not assertive with people theyll walk all over you

516 im telling you it hit me like brick

516 theres something missing from my boilermaker
516 dont worry so much sid itll never happen
516 if only could block out those feelings
516 im lucky never get headaches
516 im told this place is an acquired taste
517 so told her come on babe live every moment like its your last
517 concrete metaphor comes to mind
517 this place attracts lot of movers and shakers
517 they cant prove thing without the scythe
517 life sentence are you sure
517 your sunny disposition isnt gonna win this one for us
517 if they ask you your name is gr put your game face on and dont be so grim
517 well just tell the jury youre from the hood it doesnt sound as grim
517 nothing is that grim
517 no you shouldnt take the stand
517 then said the irs does not believe in karma mr smith
517 the judge and jury may not look too kindly at your professional success
517 dont know what will happen if the judge sentences you to life
517 lets face it you look like hoodlum
517 we need for you to reap the benefit of the doubt from the jury
517 get it but im on track for partner
517 technically they arent your peers but at least theyre all seniors
517 yes of course my fee is negotiable
517 im going underground until this blows over
517 usually the other side raises the specter of the death penalty
517 no kafkaesque trial isnt good enough reason to plead fifth
517 think its better if you dont testify
517 no magistrate in the country will convict were just supervising
517 knight to queens bishop
517 habeus corpus
517 so this is the hoodie with the sixmonth wait list that everyone is talking about
517 when the judge says something you disagree with try to not point at him ominously
517 if the hoodie does not fit they will not acquit
517 in the eyes of the jury removing your hoodie might make you seem little more human
517 will not let you speak in your own defense mr reaper
517 no gr life sentence is not good thing
517 we really need to stress to the jury that guilty verdict would be against the best interests of everyone involved
517 what are you doing here now you are expected after the judgement
517 try not to look so guilty
517 doubt youll get life sentence
517 think have conflict of interest
517 bad news from the da the death penalty is off the table
517 okay you can take the stand but dont talk them to death
517 yes you can plead selfdefense if youre not bothered by loud laughter
517 theyre starting to run out of prosecutors
517 if you testify it will difficult to avoid death sentence
517 dont worry its mortality as whole thats on trial
517 you have the right to remain silent but itll look like youre hiding something
517 were lucky this judge is rather lenient with tax evasion cases
517 could get that in writing
517 look im sorry but they dont have the death penalty in new york
517 pretrial focus groups found your outfit offputting
517 my objection was overruled your turn
517 dont worry you will get time off for good behaviour
517 the outlook is grim
517 not good the jury thinks youre hoodie
517 youre right you should do the closing argument
517 what do you think they do once the minute limit is up
517 youre making jury selection rather difficult
517 theyre asking for to but think we can bargain them up to death
517 think we have ghost of chance at least
517 im dead serious
517 your scythe set off the metal detectors huh
517 its not good word is the prosecutor is going for murder everyone
517 the only two things in life that are certain are death and taxes thats why we want to hire you
517 larry the grim reaper look isnt great choice to wear to your hearing this morning
517 you may prejudice the jury
517 think the hoodie is overkill
517 ill give you if you read off this pad and whisper something in my ear during the trial
518 maybe its time you think outside the box
518 mr unabomber your legal fees are paid by isis

526 lets talk endlessly about your feelings and my inadequacies
526 what do you mean they only come in two sizes
526 shhh stole it from ghandi
526 it was only dollar more to supersize it
526 apparently pride is not one of the seven deadly sins
526 sorry dont date angels with big halos
526 its loaner while mines in the shop
526 mean to brag but true that my large halo is indicative and if your small halo means what believe it does this could be match made in heaven
526 used to have huge afro

526 this way its better for hulahooping
526 youre really going to blame me for the halo diedthats all did did not ask for one this big oh come on dont give me that look
526 stop worrying about my fidelity god will not let me remove this wedding ring for eternity

534 his said he used to work at amazon which is technically true
534 put him in charge of lowhanging fruit
534 impressive but the other attorneys brought mongoose

535 he wants to know if you can move your seat up
535 its the only way hell fall asleep
535 hes not endangered hes wearing seatbelt
535 at least when we brought home the elephant we had extra trunk room
535 this is where the blubber meets the road
535 its the only way to get him to fall asleep
535 they warned us not to feed him the growth hormone before we returned the rentacar
535 cop said he had to issue me cetacean

535 said we should get hatchback not humpback
535 shouldve read the fine print when they said adopt whale
535 the whales arent going to just save themselves
535 you have to admit that salesman was good
535 shouldnt we buckle him in if were truly out to save them
535 when we get to customs just act nonchalant
535 trust me in five years echolocation will have completely replaced gps
535 ever wonder how he knows we are taking him to the vet
535 didnt realize save the whales included transportation
535 worms what did you use
535 will you quit your blubbering back there
535 this is the last time we buy seafood at costco
535 warning objects in mirror are bigger than they appear

535 if hear any more blubbering back there im going to stop this car
535 didnt say anything when you took all those seashells

535 hey back there stop your blubbering
535 we saved him now what
535 call it the mother theresa approach if you cant save all the whales just save one

536 im tired of being the smart car the girls all go for the muscle cars
536 lets go back to the day you found out you were preowned

536 and you feel that the road never hugs you in return
536 and do you consume ethanol on daily basis
536 would you describe yourself as selfstarter
536 first of all do you have insurance
536 well can validate your feelings but not your parking
536 you can break down if you need to
536 im afraid were out of time is someone coming to pick you up
536 well problems may appear larger in your rearview
536 you bet im going to charge you
536 how much baggage could you possibly have
536 tell me more about your auto body experience

536 how long have you been afraid of clowns
536 that voice you hear in your head its the radio
536 would you describe yourself as selfdriven

538 in my defense the neutering was requirement of the condo board
538 first of all id like to apologize for the whole laser light thing
538 may be little prick but at least im not giant pussy
538 dont forget im still the only one who knows how to operate the can opener
538 kids stay in the thimble
538 if you are going to ripup the sofa you are going to learn how to fix it
538 kill me and the can opener dies with me
538 if you eat me you wont have anyone around to ignore anymore
538 take it easy pal she neutered me too
538 so this is what the label meant by and other side effects
538 so schrodingers cat finally meets string theory
538 he realized then that shrinking himself wasnt his real mistake it was getting cat
538 honey run the can opener quick
538 seriously youll just cough me up
538 one of us is having bad dream
538 honeywas the cat food made by monsanto
538 it was then that bill realized he had made terrible mistake wishing for ton of pussy
538 so that would be no on the cat sweater then
538 thought id sew pussycat
538 easy now kitty how about we work together until we figure out whose dream this is
538 one of us is in the wrong cartoon
538 absolutely the last time catsit for gulliver
538 you knew was terrible wizard when you married me
538 know this is how you perceive me but in reality im twenty times your size and control your food
538 what happened to you just ignoring me all the time
538 looks like my wish for shrink may have been misinterpreted
538 remember how everyone was saying you should be neutered but said no
538 dont make me call the dog
538 keep in mind only get one life
538 you stop calling me little will stop calling you big
538 small lives matter
538 calm down its the catnip talking
538 dont come any closer im allergic
538 it was then that archie realized he hadnt paid close enough attention to the nongmo cat food label
538 you seemed much cuter online
538 im afraid things got out of proportion here
538 understand your frustration but your boots wont be ready until thursday after
538 one of us has eaten too many mushrooms
538 kind of wishing id grabbed the laser pointer instead
538 this is the last time we drop acid and catnip together
538 stay back im allergic
538 cant you go back to being aloof
538 when the sign said worlds biggest cathouse guess misunderstood
538 this situation has gotten completely out of proportion
538 guess youre not personcat
538 you have nine lives and have ten needles any questions
538 if youd just work with me think we have best selling childrens book here
538 look neither of us want an alteration
538 have got to start reading the list of side effects with my medication
538 hate being part of the shrinking middle class
538 you might be her cat but im her little man so back off
538 so am in your dream or are you in mine
538 either youre subconscious dream manifestation of my exwife or im in really big trouble
538 your other left paw
